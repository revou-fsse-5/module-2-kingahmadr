<br><br><br>

![Add your main domain](/README-assets/2024-07-06_10-00.png "Add your main domain")
<br><br><br>

- After adding your main domain into the custom site on Netifly, add the external DNS for the verification. We ought to add the CNAME record to our DNS manager so that the Netifly can verify the domain owner.
Since I use CloudFlare as my DNS manager, I need to add those record to my CloudFlare as well.
